# Natours Extension

Natours is a fictional tour company. Its landing page was built by me following the design explained by Jonas Schmedtmann as part of his
Advanced CSS & Sass course on Udemy. 

The three additional pages (About, All-Tours & Tour) are an extension to the original website and were built and designed by me, using HTML, pure CSS along with the Sass pre-processor 
(specifically using SCSS syntax).
